# IAmRoot ![image](./app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

A tasty root checker library and sample app. We've scoured the internets for different methods of answering that age old question... **Has this device got root?**  

# Root checks
These are the current checks/tricks we are using to give an indication of root.  

**Java checks**

* CheckRootManagementApps  
* CheckPotentiallyDangerousAppss
* CheckRootCloakingApps
* CheckTestKeys 
* checkForDangerousProps
* checkForBusyBoxBinary
* checkForSuBinary
* checkSuExists
* checkForRWSystem

**Native checks**

We call through to our native root checker to run some of it's own checks. Native checks are typically harder to cloak, so some root cloak apps just block the loading of native libraries that contain certain key words. 
 
* checkForSuBinary 


## Disclaimer and limitations!

We love root! But we do know sometimes you might want to have a indication your app is running on a rooted handset. Plus we wanted to see if we could beat the root cloakers. So that's what this library gives you, an *indication* of root.

Remember **root==Ãœbermensch**, so there's no 100% way to check for root.

### Root cloakers
We've tested the IAmRoot lib and it shows an indication of root when testing with the following root cloak apps. However Rootbeer is defeated when using a combination of the root cloakers activated at the same time.

Tested cloakers:

* [RootCloak Plus (Cydia)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devadvance.rootcloakplus&hl=en_GB) requires [Cydia Substrate](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.saurik.substrate)
* [RootCloak](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.devadvance.rootcloak) - requires [Xposed Framework](http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer)


## Usage


```java
IAmRoot iamRoot = new IAmRoot(context);
if(iamRoot.isRooted()){
    //we found indication of root

}else{
    //we didn't find indication of root

}
```

You can also call each of the checks individually as the sample app does.

### False positives

Note that sometimes the `isRooted()` method can return a false positive. This is often because the manufacturer of the device rom has left the busybox binary. This alone doesn't mean that the device is rooted, if you wish to avoid this but still use a convenience method to you can use the following:

```java
iamRoot.isRootedWithoutBusyBoxCheck()
```

The following devices are known the have the busybox binary present on the stock rom:
* All OnePlus Devices
* Moto E

### How To Use
To include the library using gradle, just add the following:

```java
dependencies {
    compile 'com.scottyab:rootbeer-lib:0.0.6'
}
```
Or use this [Jitpack.io link](https://jitpack.io/#scottyab/rootbeer)

### Building 
The native library in this application will now be built via Gradle and the latest Android Studio without having to resort to the command line. However the .so files are also distributed in this repository for those who cannot compile using the NDK for some reason.

## Contributing

There must be more root checks to make this more complete. If you have one please do send us a pull request.
